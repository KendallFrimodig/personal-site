# Some history

- isaac wilhelm frimodig left the northernmost region of scandinavia in the late 1870's and arrived in the upper peninsula of michigan

- meidell hofstan frimodig then became a troll (south of the mackinaw bridge) and set up camp at duck lake, where my grandfather was born and the majority of weekends during my youth up were spent

- my father grew up in ada, just east of grand rapids. though I would consider myself well traveled this is where I would spend most my life until finishing graduate school

# Fun facts
